# 🚀 Welcome to My Lovable Project

Hi there! I'm currently building this project using **Lovable** — a powerful platform that blends visual editing with modern web development tools.

## ✏️ How I Work on This Project

There are multiple ways I edit and manage this project — both online and locally.

### ✅ 1. Using Lovable (Fast & Visual)

Most of the time, I use the visual editor provided by Lovable:

➡️ [Edit in Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/3375c1e9-b04b-4acd-bca4-e5ab64e467ed)

Any changes I make there are automatically committed to this GitHub repository.

### 💻 2. Using My Local IDE

For full control and local development, I also work in my own environment.

> Make sure you have Node.js & npm installed. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage versions.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to the project folder
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
